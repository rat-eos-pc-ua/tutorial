# Tutorial


This repository provides a comprehensive guide on integrating new sensors into our platform. We can add data to our plataform  using the TTN integrations. The objective is to set up a pipeline that retrieves data from sensors, sends it to Kafka and visualizes it on our platform.

RAT EOS PC project aims towards the development of a unique risk index suitable for the Mediterranean climate, which requires analysing various biophysical and vegetation indices.  
Upon accessing the [https://data.atnog-iot4fire.av.it.pt/](https://data.rateospc.pt/)  users are presented with several types of visualizations aimed at providing clear and comprehensive insights into meteorological conditions and fire risks across Portugal and Spain
